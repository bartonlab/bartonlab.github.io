This website hosts the scientific work of the Barton lab. John Barton is an associate professor in the Department of Computational and Systems Biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The design combines [Paul Le](https://lenpaul.github.io/)'s [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) template with scripts and layouts cloned from [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/)'s page, which you can also find [here on GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter).
