# The lab opens at UCR

This winter I'll be moving from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), which has been my home for the past 5 years, to start my own research group in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.physics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). It's an exciting time, and I can't wait to get started.

I'm currently recruiting graduate (or undergraduate) students, and I have space for one postdoc as well. Check [here](../../join.md) for more information.
