# NIH R35 MIRA and collaborative R01

This summer we've been fortunate to receive two major grants to support our research.

First, we received a Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) from the NIH. This grant will support the development of new methods to infer selection from temporal genetic data. We're excited to begin work on this project. An advertisement for a new postdoc position supported by this grant will be posted soon!

Second, we are excited to work on a collaborative project led by [Dr. Rebecca Lynch](https://smhs.gwu.edu/lynch-lab/) at George Washington University to define the fitness cost of HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies, supported by an R01 from the NIAID! Other team members include [Dr. Will Fischer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aJpRxEoAAAAJ&hl=en) from Los Alamos National Laboratory and [Dr. Florian Klein](https://klein-lab.de/) from the University of Cologne.
