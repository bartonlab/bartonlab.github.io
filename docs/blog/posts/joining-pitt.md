# Moving the lab to CSB at Pitt

After a few wonderful years in the Physics department at UCR, the lab is moving to join the [Department of Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/). Thank you to all of our colleagues and friends at UCR for a great experience in Riverside.

At Pitt, we're looking forward to deepening our work in evolution and immunology, and working together with groups such as the [Center for Evolutionary Biology and Medicine](https://www.cebam.pitt.edu/) and the [Center for Systems Immunology](https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/systemsimmunology).
