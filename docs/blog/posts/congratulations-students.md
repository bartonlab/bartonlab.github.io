# Three PhD students graduate

Congratulations to Marco Garcia Noceda, Yawei Qin, and Zhenchen Hong! In the last few months, all three successfully completed their defenses and received their PhDs from UCR's Department of Physics and Astronomy. This closes a chapter for us, as Marco, Yawei, and Zhenchen (together with Yunxiao Li, who graduated last fall) were the first graduate students to join the lab. 

All three are taking their talents to industry. Marco is joining Adaptive Biotechnologies, Yawei is joining CGG SA, and Zhenchen will be working with Ernst and Young. Thank you all again for your great work in the lab.
