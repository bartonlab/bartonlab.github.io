# Joining the lab

We are currently interested in recruiting one or more graduate (or undergraduate) students who are interested in working on problems in immunology, evolution, and statistical inference, like the ones [described here](research.md). Ultimately, lab projects usually involve a combination of theory, computation, and careful data analysis -- often together with experimental collaborators.

Students at Pitt or CMU should send me an email to set up a meeting. I'm always excited to discuss open projects. Analytical and/or computational skills are a must to get started. Deep experience with biology is also a plus, but it's not a requirement.

While we are not currently actively recruiting postdocs, interested applicants can send a CV and a brief summary of research interests via email. It's helpful to hear a little about who you are as a researcher and why you'd like to work together. If you're interested in applying for postdoctoral funding through sources like the [Human Frontier Science Program](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) (for PhD students outside the US), the [Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research](https://www.jccfund.org/), the [Life Sciences Research Foundation](https://lsrf.org/) the [NIH](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships), or NSF, let me know as well and I'd be happy to help with your application.
