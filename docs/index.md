# Lab overview

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/). My lab's overarching mission is to help solve problems that will improve how we prevent and treat disease. Our primary biological focus is on evolution, especially the evolution of viral pathogens, and immunity. We work closely with a variety of collaborators, from mathematicians and theoretical physicists to immunologists, virologists, and microbiologists. You can read more about our research interests on the [research page](research.md).

I graduated from Duke University with degrees in Physics and Mathematics, and completed my PhD in Physics with [Joel Lebowitz](https://www.sas.rutgers.edu/cms/math/people-cmsr/faculty-profiles-cmsr/63-lebowitz-joel) at Rutgers University. I did my postdoctoral work in the interdisciplinary lab of [Arup Chakraborty](https://web.mit.edu/akcgroup/) in the [Institute for Medical Engineering and Science](https://imes.mit.edu/) at MIT. Before moving to Pitt, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/).
