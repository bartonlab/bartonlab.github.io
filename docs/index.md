# Lab overview

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/). My group studies how viruses evolve and interact with the immune system. Increasingly, we're also interested in general quantitative studies of evolution. Much of our work focuses on statistical inference, where we develop theoretical and computational methods to learn as much as we can from data. Our goal is to improve our understanding of evolving pathogens, and ultimately to develop better therapies and vaccines to fight against them. We work closely with a variety of collaborators, from mathematicians and theoretical physicists to immunologists, virologists, and microbiologists. You can read more about our research interests on the [research page](research.md).

I graduated from Duke University with degrees in Physics and Mathematics, and completed my PhD in Physics with [Joel Lebowitz](https://www.sas.rutgers.edu/cms/math/people-cmsr/faculty-profiles-cmsr/63-lebowitz-joel) at Rutgers University. I did my postdoctoral work in the interdisciplinary lab of [Arup Chakraborty](https://web.mit.edu/akcgroup/) in the [Institute for Medical Engineering and Science](https://imes.mit.edu/) at MIT. Before moving to Pitt, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/).
