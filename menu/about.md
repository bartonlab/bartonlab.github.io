title: About
---

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine](https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/). My group studies how viruses evolve and interact with the immune system. Increasingly, we're also interested in general quantitative studies of evolution. A lot of our work focuses on statistical inference, i.e., developing theory and computational methods to learn as much as we can from modern experimental data. Our goal is to use the information that we learn to better understand evolving pathogens, and ultimately to develop better therapies and vaccines to fight against them. I collaborate closely with a broad spectrum of scientists, from mathematicians and theoretical physicists to experimental and clinical immunologists and virologists. You can learn more about my specific research interests on the [research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/menu/research.html).

I graduated from Duke University with degrees in Physics and Mathematics, and completed my PhD in Physics with [Joel Lebowitz](https://www.sas.rutgers.edu/cms/math/people-cmsr/faculty-profiles-cmsr/63-lebowitz-joel) at Rutgers University. I did my postdoctoral work in the interdisciplinary lab of [Arup Chakraborty](https://web.mit.edu/akcgroup/) in the [Institute for Medical Engineering and Science](https://imes.mit.edu/) at MIT. Before moving to Pitt, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/).
