I'm looking for prospective graduate (or undergraduate) students and postdocs who are interested in working on problems in immunology, evolution, and statistical inference, like the ones [described here]({{ site.baseurl }}/menu/research.html). Ultimately, the projects I'm interested in usually involve a little bit of theory, a little bit of computation, and a careful look at real data -- often together with experimental collaborators.

Students at Pitt or CMU should send me an email to set up a meeting. I'm always excited to discuss open projects. Analytical and/or computational skills are a must to get started. Deep experience with biology is also a plus, but it's not a requirement.

Prospective postdocs should also send a CV and a brief summary of your research interests. Tell me a little about who you are as a researcher and why you'd like to work together. If you're interested in applying for postdoctoral funding through sources like [HFSP](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) (for PhD students outside the US), [JSMF](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/), the [NIH](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships), or NSF, let me know as well and I'd be happy to help with your application.
